SONIA: Okay, I've been thinking about this a lot - what do you guys think is actually the point of therapy?
ARIELLE: It's really about relationships - "it's like a specific type of relationship that's been developed through science" where through that connection, people can understand themselves better or work through problems.
MERYL: Yeah, I think there are different categories though. "Like therapy when you have a really like much more severe mental health issue that needs immediate intervention" versus the more general stuff we all deal with.
SONIA: See, I look at it differently. "I feel like I'm in therapy to like put together puzzle pieces." It's not really about the relationship for me - it's about seeing patterns and making connections.
MERYL: How do your sessions usually work?
SONIA: "Honestly, it's pretty banal. Like somebody just says like, 'so how are you doing? How's your week going?' But then you're supposed to answer honestly as opposed to how you answer every other time somebody asks you that."
PRATIK: I mean, looking at AI, it could handle all of that. Regular therapists come with their own biases and approaches, but AI could adapt to exactly what each person needs.
ARIELLE: Yeah but that's what bothers me about AI therapy. You're trying to remove all the friction, all the struggle of actually connecting with another person.
MERYL: I tried one of these AI therapy apps recently. "I asked it about this brunch with some girls that didn't make me feel good, and everything I said it validated." Just kept agreeing with whatever I said.
SONIA: But think about what AI could actually do - if you gave it access to all your journal entries, all your conversations, it could see patterns a human might miss.
ARIELLE: "When an AI bot remembers a message you sent two weeks ago, it means literally nothing because the message is stored. When a human remembers something, it says a million intangible things."
PRATIK: You say that, but if an AI therapist could give better insights, better help, why does it matter how it got there?
ARIELLE: Because therapy isn't just about getting answers. "It's about forming a relationship with this person you're interacting with."
SONIA: But that raises an interesting question - imagine there was this situation where you could plug your brain into a machine, and it could give you the perfect life, perfect relationships, perfect therapy. Everything would feel completely real to you. Would you want that?
ARIELLE: "I reject completelyâ€”"
PRATIK: "I would be indifferent whether it was a vat or a real thing."
MERYL: "That's crazy!"
PRATIK: "If you feel the exact same things and you perceive the exact same life, why does it matter?"
ARIELLE: "I feel like you're devaluing human life and human experience a little bit. Because you're indifferent between being in a box and living your life."
SONIA: "My not wanting to live in a vat is irrational reaction. Irrational reactions."
ARIELLE: "Grace! Because it's what makes us human. It's true."
MERYL: Look, I think this same principle applies to therapy. "You are interacting with someone that has their own set of life experiences and has something different to share with you." That's fundamentally different from interacting with a simulation, even a perfect one.
SONIA: But we might be heading there whether we like it or not. "I think about some of the people, like the two good therapists I've had were somebody who I saw in Philly who was out of network, and the guy who your mom hooked me up with, who was great, also out of network. I think about how many therapists I've tried for like two sessions who were like, in-network therapists - terrible."
PRATIK: That's what I'm saying. And where is this all heading? "My prediction is it's going to be a little wacky - people will have AI friends and they'll want their AI therapist for those AI friends."
MERYL: "You think people are going to have AI friends?"
SONIA: "Like hanging out with your AI friends in a virtual room. I feel like that's right around the corner."
ARIELLE: That's exactly what worries me. "Once again, you are replacing a human interaction that contains frictions. Like that person is coming with their own training and their own set of thinking, and you need to find them. And sometimes you'll encounter one that's not a good fit for you."
MERYL: I see both sides here. "I think what you're describing, Sonia, like a tool where you can upload all your past journals and all that - I think that is super fascinating and super useful." But it's different from therapy.
SONIA: But therapy is so expensive right now. If AI could help more people get access to mental health support...
ARIELLE: "I think there are a lot of things I think are hopeful about integrating AI as a technology into mental health access and treatment. But what are we losing when we get rid of all those frictions?"
PRATIK: What about for people who can't afford regular therapy though? Isn't some support better than none?
SONIA: "I just think we're going to get to a point where AI is better at these sorts of things than the average person. Sure, you can say there's something ephemeral about therapy, and there is, but I don't know that an LLM couldn't pass itself off as having that kind of life experience."
MERYL: Maybe there's room for both? The human connection where it's needed, and AI tools to help make therapy more accessible and effective?
ARIELLE: "I think it would be more appropriate to put our money and our energy into making human therapy more accessible and better than making AI better for therapy."
SONIA: "It just seems like such an intractable problem" though. How do we actually make therapy more accessible?
PRATIK: Maybe that's where AI comes in - not replacing therapists entirely, but helping expand access where it's needed most.
ARIELLE: As long as we don't lose sight of what makes therapy actually work - real human connection, understanding, growth. Those frictions you're trying to eliminate? That's where the real healing happens.
