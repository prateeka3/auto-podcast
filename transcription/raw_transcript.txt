Ariel: Is it to each, to, to move this to a remote meeting- 
Sonia: No. 
Ariel: ... for the sake of we're not doing that. 
Participant_A: We could sit in different rooms. (laughs) 
Sonia: Absolutely not. 
Pradip: So I, I found a solution to that. Even if you're in the same room, you can split the voice- 
Ariel: Okay. 
Pradip: ... you can split who said what based on the voices. Um- 
Ariel: (laughs) 
Pradip: ... and okay, I'll go down that thread a lot later, but- 
Ariel: You want me to record, Pradip? 
Pradip: Yeah, I started recording on my end just, just in case Sonia said something else. 
Ariel: Already? 
Participant_A: Yeah. 
Ariel: You already started. Pradip, don't start. 
Sonia: There's a, there's a catch. Every time you speak, you have to scream your name. (laughs) 
Pradip: (laughs) 
Ariel: (Laughs) Oh, okay. Here. (door closing) Great. Now we're being recorded. 
Sonia: Wait, so how are we doing it? 
Pradip: So basically, I'll just get this one recording. I think your recording will be better than mine, but I just wanna see the options. But, uh, there's another AI tool called Speaker Diarization that you can just throw it, throw the recording through and it'll split the voices, and then we can do all sorts of things with it, right? Like summaries and- 
Sonia: Cool. 
Pradip: ... yeah. 
Sonia: Go ahead. 
Ariel: Oh, cool. Um, wait. I actually wanna start with a question that's not quite AI yet, but I do think it's a good foundation because every time I've talked to somebody about AI in therapy, this comes up. What do you guys think is the point of therapy? All right, I'll meet you guys- 
Sonia: You think that's a place to start? 
Ariel: Yeah. 
Pradip: (laughs) . 
Ariel: I do. 
Pradip: Ariel's mom should be here. 
Ariel: (laughs) 
Sonia: Fair enough. Fair enough. 
Ariel: You think about it. I'm gonna go get some more food. One sec. 
Pradip: Wait, you know how we were talking about having experts come in?
